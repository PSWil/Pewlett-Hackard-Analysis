# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
In this project we were asked to analyze the workforce at Pewlett Hackard to determine which employees will be eligible for retirement in the near future, and if those retiring employees would be a nice fit for a mentoring program that Pewlett Hackard would like to impliment in order to make this coming transition easier.  To accomplish this, I have been tasked with identifying employees who are most likely to retire soon by their title and employees who could transition to a part time mentorship program as opposed to retiring outright. To manage the employment records and data and identify likely candidates I used PostgresSQL.
